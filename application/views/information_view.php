Always follow references from security personnel.</br>At the concert site, DO NOT contact 112! Contact the security sta  on site. This is done through radio channel 1 or 16. There are radios in all ports, stalls and bars.</br>In case of fire you must immediately leave the site and contact security personnel via radio. Then you may try to extinguish the fire, if it’s possible and safe.</br>Do you, a colleague or a guest require first aiders, you should refer to the first-aiders station. Is it acute first aiders can be called via radio channel 1 or 16.</br>Fights, threats and similar is not accepted in any way. If you see or get involved in this you need to call the guards. Always remember to keep well away from a fight and let the guards handle the situation.</br>At Tinderbox work environment and safety for our volunteers is very important. We have made several initiatives to make the safety of our volunteers as high as possible. However, we also encourage everyone to consider their own and others’ safety. Use common sense on your own and others’ behalf, keep an eye on what is going on around you, so you can take care of yourself and your colleagues.
